# Passive DNS Demo

This repository holds the Passive DNS frontend built (see the [docs branch](https://github.com/PassiveDNS/PassiveDNS.github.io/tree/docs)).

It is deployed using the Github Pages: https://passivedns.github.io/

To access the application as a user, you can use the credentials:
- username: `demo`
- password: `demo`

To access it as an admin:
- username: `admin`
- password: `admin`

The data available is all static and mocked. No API and database is binded to this frontend.
Therefore, you cannot add or delete any of the data.

To have a deeper look about all the available features (like domain creation, channel usage...), you should install the project on your machine:
